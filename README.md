## Understanding Skills

### Read `SKILL.md` to understand how agent skill works and how instructions are interpreted.

This will help you:

- Understand how the agent selects and executes commands
- Craft more precise prompts for your own use cases
- Customize or extend behavior by updating `SKILL.md` to match your workflow
- Modifying `SKILL.md` allows you to tailor skill to your recon style and testing needs
